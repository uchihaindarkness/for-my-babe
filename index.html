            Question no 7 : What is the applications of a kater's pendulumn? 
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 7 : At that time,the 'Time' was measured by pendulumn based clocks. And the time period of a pendulumn depends on the local value of 'g'.
            <ul>
                <li>
            So for accurate measurement of time, it was important to know the accurate value og 'g'.
            </li>
            <li>additionally, the local value of 'g' also helped to find the minerals and for other geophsycial surveys</li>
            <li>But presently , kater's pendulumn is used only for demonstration purpose.</li>
        </ul>
        <span>
            Question no 8 : Why kater's pendulumn is called a reversible pendulumn? 
        </span>
        <div>
            Anser no 8 : The value of g can be determined by measuring the lenght L and period time T. The value of T can be measured accurately, but the accurate measurement of the lenght of the pendulumn is not easy. We know centre of suspension but it is hard to estimate the exact position of the centre of oscillation. (see Q no 5 )
            We can use reversible kater's pendulumn, to overcome this difficulty two knife-edges and two adjustable masses are positioned on the rod so that the period of swing is almost the same from either edge.
            and there is no need to find the centre of oscillation
            <p>
                this is also the reason of its accuracy

            Question no 9 : Why T1 and T2 should be close?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 9 : Using kater's pendulumn the 'g' is calculated by formula given below
            <img src="Screenshot 2025-04-08 064253.png" alt="the formula is this">
            <ul>
                <li>I1 + I2 being the distance between the knife edges, can be measured accurately.</li>
                <li>I1 - I2 is more difficult to measure accurately, because accurate location of the centre of mass G is difficult.</li>
                <li>If T1 + T2 are very nearly exqual , the second term in this equation is quite small compared to the first, and I1 - I2 does not have to be known as accurately as I1 + I2 .</li>

            Question no 1 : Explain the principle of the static method for determining the modulus of rigidity of a wire.
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 1 : The static method involves applying a known force to a wire, causing it to deform (usually elongate). By measuring the extension of the wire and using the relationship between stress and strain, the modulus of rigidity can be calculated. The tension in the wire creates a shear stress, and the amount of deformation (strain) gives the modulus value.

        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 4 : Several factors can influence the modulus of a wire:
            <ul>
                <li>Material of the wire: Different materials (like steel, copper, etc.) have different Young's Modulus values.</li>
                <li>Temperature: Temperature can affect the elasticity of the wire and thus its modulus.</li>
                <li>Wire diameter: The cross-sectional area of the wire influences the stress calculation, which affects the modulus.</li>
                <li>Length of the wire: The original length affects the strain measurement.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <span>
            Question no 5 : Why do we need to measure the extension (Δ𝐿) accurately in this experiment?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 5 : The extension ( Δ𝐿 ) is critical in calculating strain, which is a component of determining Young's Modulus. Even a small error in measuring extension can lead to large inaccuracies in calculating the modulus.

        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 9 : Some key assumptions include:
            <ul>
                <li>The wire is uniform (same material, cross-sectional area along its length).</li>
                <li>The wire stays within the elastic limit, meaning it doesn’t undergo permanent deformation.</li>
                <li>The wire doesn’t experience any external forces except for the applied force (e.g., gravity).</li>
                <li>The temperature remains constant and does not significantly affect the material properties.</li>
            </ul>

            Question no 10 : What type of wire is suitable for this experiment?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 10 : A wire made from a ductile material, such as steel or copper, is suitable for this experiment. The wire should have consistent thickness and should not have any defects that could affect its elongation under stress.
        </div>
        <span>
            Question no 11 : How would you determine the cross-sectional area of the wire?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 11 : The cross-sectional area of the wire is usually calculated by measuring the diameter of the wire using a micrometer or caliper. For a wire with a circular cross-section, the area is given by:
            A=πr2
            ,Where 𝑟 is the radius of the wire.
        </div>
        <span>
            Question no 12 : What is the effect of temperature on the modulus of the wire?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 12 : Temperature can affect the modulus of the wire. As temperature increases, the atoms in the material vibrate more, and this can make the material more flexible, reducing the modulus. Conversely, at lower temperatures, materials tend to become more rigid and may show a higher modulus.
        </div>
        <span>
            Question no 13 :  How do you ensure that the force is applied gradually?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 13 :  In the experiment, the force should be applied slowly by gradually adding known weights or adjusting the tension, ensuring that the wire does not snap or exceed its elastic limit. This can be done by using a controlled weight stack or a calibrated hanging system.
        </div>
        <span>
            Question no 14 : What precautions should be taken to ensure accurate results?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 14 : Some key precautions include:
            <ul>
                <li>Use a precise micrometer to measure the wire's diameter accurately.</li>
                <li>Ensure the wire is straight and not twisted during the experiment.</li>
                <li>Perform measurements carefully for the extension, noting any small changes.</li>
                <li>Check for any permanent deformation of the wire after the force is removed.</li>
                <li>Ensure no side forces (like bending) are acting on the wire during the experiment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <span>
            Question no 15 : How would you interpret the results if the wire exhibits significant plastic deformation?
        </span>
        <div>
            Answer no 15 : If the wire shows significant plastic deformation, it means that the wire has surpassed its elastic limit and is no longer behaving according to Hooke's Law. This would lead to errors in calculating the modulus, as the assumption of elasticity is violated. In such cases, you would need to lower the applied force or use a different wire.
